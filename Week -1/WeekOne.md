A pseudorandom number generator is as the name implies, somewhat-random rather than truly random; it is entirely deterministic but produces outputs that appear random when tested statistically. A PRNG requires a seed, which is just something to initialize the function with and generate a specific sequence of numbers unique to that seed, this is why its NOT random because if given the same seed you will produce the same sequence of values. This is both it's boon and its flaw, as opposed to true random number generators which for the most part also are NOT truly random, but they're random enough to be practically impossible to track down. TRNGs measure unpredictable physical events and the chaos too sensitive to track is what qualifies them as truly random, but they aren't all the same in randomness as many sequences could be pinned down if given enough resources, but some are truly random in the sense where we fundamentally could not track them down with our understanding of physics.

The reproducibility of strings from PRNGs is used in most scientific reason because of the need to reproduce the same test results from different people. One of the key defining traits of science is the ability to reproduce the same tests, but if you used truly random numbers then it would be impossible for other people to get the same result as you without some major lucky guesswork hence the overall need for pseudo random. It provides enough randomness to be useful but still functions deterministically which allows for errors and 3rd party testing to reproduce the same result.
